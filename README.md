# Talking Connect Four
Talking Connect Four is a physical implementation of the classic Connect Four game, designed to help people with communication disorders. The game uses Arduino Nano, an SD card module, a TDA2030 audio amplifier, a speaker, and IR sensors to provide an interactive and engaging experience.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the "CODE.ino" file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino Nano board.
4. Connect the SD card module, TDA2030 audio amplifier, speaker, and IR sensors to your Arduino board according to the schematic provided in the "Simulation.pdf" file.
5. Power on the Arduino board and the game is ready to play!
# Usage
To play the game, simply drop the colored tokens into the game board using the IR sensors. The game board has been laser-cut to provide a visually appealing and tactile experience that is reminiscent of a real Connect Four game. As the tokens are dropped, the game will provide audio feedback using the speaker and TDA2030 audio amplifier, allowing players to engage with the game through sound as well as touch.
